# Optimize and deploy ðŸ¤— Transformer models with Optimum-Intel and OpenVINO GenAI

When it comes to the Edge or Client deployment of the Transformers models Python is not always a suitable solution for this purpose. Many ISV's applications are written in C++ and require model inference API to be also in C++. Another aspect of such deployment is the application footprint which also should be minimized to simplify SW installation and update. [OpenVINO Toolkit](https://docs.openvino.ai/) initially emerged as a C++ AI inference solution that has bindings to popular programming languages such as Python or Java. It continues to be popular for Edge and Client deployment with the minimum dependencies on 3rd party SW libraries.

Recently, OpenVINO introduced [Generative AI (GenAI) API](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/learn-openvino/llm_inference_guide/genai-guide.html) designed to simplify integration of Generative AI model inference into C++ (or Python) application with the minimum external dependencies. LLM inference is the first feature in GenAI API that is currently available. OpenVINO GenAI SW package is supplied with [OpenVINO Tokenizers](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/learn-openvino/llm_inference_guide/ov-tokenizers.html) library required for text tokenization-detokenization which is lightweight and has C++ API as well. GenAI repository also contains various [examples](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/tree/master/samples): from naive LLM decoder-based inference to speculative decoding.

In this blog post, we will outline the LLM deployment steps that include exporting model from Transformers library to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) using [Optimum-Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/intel/index), model optimization with [Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf), and deployment with new GenAI API. We will guide the user through all these steps and highlight changes of basic model KPIs, namely accuracy and performance.

## Exporting model from ðŸ¤— Transformers to OpenVINO

ðŸ¤— and Intel have a long story of collaboration and [Optimum-Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/intel/index) project is a part of this story. It is designed to optimize Transformers models for inference on Intel HW. Optimum-Intel supports OpenVINO as an inference backend and its API has wrappers for various model architectures built on top of OpenVINO inference API. All of these wrappers start from `OV` prefix, for example, `OVModelForCausalLM`. Otherwise, it is similar to the API of ðŸ¤— Transformers library.

To export ðŸ¤— Transformers model to OpenVINO IR one can use two options: `.from_pretrained()` API method of the Optimum-Intel class in a Python script or do it with Optimum the command-line interface (CLI).
Further, we will use the recent Llama 3.1 8B decoder model as an example.
The export with the former option looks as follows:
```python
from optimum.intel import OVModelForCausalLM

MODEL_ID = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B"
model = OVModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID, export=True)
model.save_pretrained("./llam-3.1-8b-ov")
```

Alternatively, the same can be done with CLI as follows:
```sh
optimum-cli export openvino -m meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B ./llam-3.1-8b-ov
```

The `./llam-3.1-8b-ov` folder will contain `.xml` and `bin` IR model files and required configuration files that come from the source model. ðŸ¤— tokenizer will be also converted to the format of `openvino-tokenizers` library and corresponding configuration files will be created in the same folder.

## Model Optimization

When running LLMs on the resource constrained edge and client devices, model optimization is highly recommended step. And weight-only quantization is a mainstream approach that significantly reduces latency and model footprint. Optimum-Intel provides weight-only quantization capabilities by means of NNCF which has a variety of optimization techniques designed specifically for LLMs: from data-free INT8 and INT4 weight quantization to data-aware methods such as [AWQ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/quantization/awq), [GPTQ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/quantization/gptq), quantization scale estimation, mixed-precision quantization.
By default, weights of the models that are larger than one billion parameters are quantized to INT8 precision which is safe in terms of accuracy. It means that the export steps described above lead to the model with 8-bit weights. However, 4-bit integer weight-only quantization allows achieving a better accuracy-performance trade-off. 

For `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B` model we recommend stacking AWQ, quantization scale estimation along with mixed-precision INT4/INT8 quantization of weights using a calibration dataset that reflects a deployment use case. As in the case of export, there are two options on how to apply 4-bit weight-only quantization to LLM model:
- Specify `quantization_config` parameter in the `.from_pretrained()` method. In this case `OVWeightQuantizationConfig` object should be created and set to this parameter as follows:
```pythonTransformers
from optimum.intel import OVModelForCausalLM, OVWeightQuantizationConfig

MODEL_ID = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B"
quantization_config = OVWeightQuantizationConfig(awq=True, scale_estimation=True, group_size=64, dataset="c4")
model = OVModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID, export=True, quantization_config=quantization_config)
model.save_pretrained("./llam-3.1-8b-ov")
```

- Use command-line options to enable 4-bit weight-only quantization:
```sh
optimum-cli export openvino -m meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B --weight-format int4 --awq --scale-estimation --group-size 64 --dataset wikitext2 ./llam-3.1-8b-ov
```

>**Note**: The model optimization process can take time as it and applies several methods subsequently and uses model inference over the specified dataset.

Model optimization with API is more flexible as it allows using custom datasets that can be passed as an iterable object, for example, and instance of `Dataset` object of ðŸ¤— library or just a list of strings.

Weight quantization usually introduces some degradation of the accuracy metric. To compare optimized and source models we report Word Perplexity metric measured on the [Wikitext](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/wikitext_document_level) dataset with [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness.git) project which support both ðŸ¤— Transformers and Optimum-Intel models out-of-the-box.

| Model                        | PPL PyTorch FP32 | OpenVINO INT8 | OpenVINO INT4 |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B |   7.3366         | 7.3463        | 7.8288        | 

## Deploy model with OpenVINO GenAI API

Now, we have successfully converted and optimized Llama-3.1-8B model. Let's first run it with Python API of OpenVINO GenAI as the easiest path from ðŸ¤— Optimum-Intel. The basic concept of this API is `LLMPipeline` class. Its instance can be created directly from the folder with the converted model. It will automatically load the main model, tokenizer, detokenizer, and the default generation configuration. The simple greedy-search text generation example with the Python version of `LLMPipeline` looks as follows:
```python
import argparse
import openvino_genai

device = "CPU"  # GPU can be used as well
pipe = openvino_genai.LLMPipeline(args.model_dir, device)
config = openvino_genai.GenerationConfig()
config.max_new_tokens = 100
print(pipe.generate(args.prompt, config))
```

To run this example you need minimum dependencies to be installed into the Python enviroment as OpenVINO GenAI is designed to provide a lightweight deployment. You can install OpenVINO GenAI package to the same Python environemt or create a separate one to compare the application footprint:
```sh
pip install openvino-genai==24.3
```

Let's see how to run the same pipilene with OpenVINO GenAI C++ API. The GenAI API is designed to be intuitive and provides a seamless migration from ðŸ¤— Transformers API. 
```cpp
#include "openvino/genai/llm_pipeline.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
   std::string model_path = "./llama-3.1-8b-ov";
   std::string device = "CPU"  // GPU can be used as well
   ov::genai::LLMPipeline pipe(model_path, device);
   std::cout << pipe.generate("What is LLM model?", ov::genai::max_new_tokens(256));
}
```

`LLMPipeline` also allows specifying custom generation options by means of `ov::genai::GenerationConfig`:
```cpp
ov::genai::GenerationConfig config;
config.max_new_tokens = 256;
std::string result = pipe.generate(prompt, config);
```

GenAI code samples demostrate streaming and chat scenarios as well as Beam Search, etc. For example, one can use the following API to plug streamer to the text generation process:

```cpp
ov::genai::GenerationConfig config;
config.max_new_tokens = 100;
config.do_sample = true;
config.top_p = 0.9;
config.top_k = 30;
auto streamer = [](std::string subword) {
    std::cout << subword << std::flush;
    return false;
};

// Since the streamer is set, the results will
// be printed each time a new token is generated.
pipe.generate(prompt, config, streamer);
```
